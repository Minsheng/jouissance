        <p>Hey guys… back here, just letting anyone still not sure about Jouissance, that it’s worth it, get in with us, get on the #Skinning boat with us! This world is fucked and getting more fucked everyday, did you guys hear about that pulse or flare or whatever that knocked out Korea? All tech down, massive panic. Nobody knows why? Thats Bullshit. Either way time spent in Jouissance is worth it, time isn't an issue in there, everything is just so….so fucking good! (Deeper laugh) (Twitch) Sorry… some idiot player from Seoul tried to contact me about issues in their servers, some connection with the flare (Twitch) … Ha but anyway, I'm telling you guys and gals, whatever fucking identity you think you got, come to Jouissance and find out what it's like to exist between the lines… (Twitch) Later!</p>

        <p>Hey Guys its me, signing in to talk about this opportunity that's dropped into my lap! I (Pause for laugh) I’m not sure where to start with this, it almost sounds too good to be real, forgive the cliche, but it's almost beyond words. Almost. So this startup out of the blue got in touch with me through my channel, sounds like they’ve got a few other colleagues of mine in the tech review circle. Anyway, they sound pretty pretentious to me “Jouissance?” (pause for laugh) but whatever, What they’re doing is beyond. So we’re into all this VR right now, still shit you gotta wear right? Basic premise, wear this and get ready to head into a new world! Thanks to a giant pair of goggles strapped to your face… These guys take it to a new level. I’ve been wracking my brains trying to find out how they do it, but they promise a VR experience like no other… Tomorrow I’ll find out, but apparently you’ve got to drink like two litres of water ? Guess i’m off to buy a few jugs. Later Guys!! (Sign out) </p>
